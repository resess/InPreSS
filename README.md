# InPreSS

This repository hosts InPress, a regression analysis approach based on program slicing. 
Given a test failure and two versions of a program and a test passing on one and failing on the other version of the program, 
InPreSS automatically generates a summarized version of the slices produced by the dual slicing technique.
