# TRregression (ERASE)
TRregression (Trace-Based Regression ) aims to analyze execution trace to find regression bug.

# Source Code Configuration
## Dependency
The TRegression (i.e., ERASE) project relies on Microbat project to collect execution Trace of Java program. When you are importing tregression project, you need to important Microbat project (https://github.com/llmhyy/microbat) as well. Note that all the projects are Eclipse plugin project. The imported projects are listed as follows:
- microbat (mirobat)
- microbat_instrumentator (mirobat)
- microbat_junit_test (mirobat)
- mutation (mirobat)
- sav.commons (mirobat)
- tregression (tregression)

Moreover, this prototype are build on top of Defects4J bugs. We forked Defects4J repository (https://github.com/llmhyy/defects4j) and please checkout the buggy version and fixed version by our script. (https://github.com/llmhyy/defects4j/blob/master/checkout.sh). If you run the script successfully, you can checkout the bug file structure as follows:
bug_repo

|__ Chart (project_id)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ 1 (bug_id)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ 2   <br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|__ ...<br />
  
Last, please unzip this file (https://github.com/llmhyy/tregression/blob/master/tregression/dependent_lib/junit_lib.rar) under the dropins directory of your eclipse root folder. It contains all the runtime Java libraries.

## Running Tregression (ERASE) on Defects4J bugs
After import the projects, right-click the tregression project, and choose "Run As Eclipse Application", you can start debugging Tregression. You need to configure the settings in the Eclipse-application as follows:

Second, please switch to Tregression perspective by (Windows >> Perspectives >> Open Operspective >> Other). 

Third, click "Tregression" menu >> Run for Seperate Versions. The tool will automate the regression bug detection.
